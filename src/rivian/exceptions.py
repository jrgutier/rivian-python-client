"""Rivian exceptions.

Every exception here is raised with the HTTP status, the response JSON, the
request headers AND the request body attached (``rivian.py:772`` and
``rivian.py:773``). None of these classes defines ``__init__``, so Python renders
all of those arguments through ``str(args)`` whenever the exception is logged,
printed, or formatted into a message.

That is a credential disclosure, and it is not theoretical:

* ``headers`` carries ``A-Sess``, ``U-Sess`` and ``Csrf-Token``.
* the ``Login`` mutation body carries ``{"variables": {"email", "password"}}``.
* the Home Assistant integration logs these with ``exc_info=1``, and logs the
  failed-login case specifically -- so a mistyped password is written to
  ``home-assistant.log``, the file people attach to bug reports.

``RivianApiException.__init__`` therefore redacts sensitive values as the
exception is constructed, before anything can render it.

Two properties are deliberate:

* **Shape-agnostic.** Redaction walks every argument by key name at any depth,
  rather than keying on argument position. ``rivian.py:772`` passes four
  positional arguments while ``rivian.py:773`` passes five, with ``headers`` and
  ``body`` shifted by one -- and the five-argument form is the fallback for every
  error code absent from ``ERROR_CODE_CLASS_MAP``, so a position-keyed
  implementation would miss precisely the unclassified failures.
* **Structure-preserving.** Only leaf values are replaced. ``args[1]`` stays a
  navigable mapping because the integration reads
  ``err.args[1]["errors"][0]["extensions"]["reason"]`` to decide whether to
  re-prompt for an OTP.
