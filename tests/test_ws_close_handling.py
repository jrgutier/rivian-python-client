"""How the monitor reacts to the server's close codes.

All four codes below were MEASURED against wss://api.rivian.com, not taken from
the spec:

  4401 Unauthorized                     -- sent when we subscribe before the ack
  4403 Forbidden                        -- sent ~0.5s after a malformed u-sess
  4408 Connection initialization timeout -- sent when no connection_init arrives
  4420 Connection TTL expired           -- sent to a healthy idle connection

The old code recognised only the reason string "Unauthenticated", which is none
of these. So an auth rejection was treated as a transient drop and retried
forever -- and because `attempt` was reset to 0 whenever the socket merely
OPENED, a 4403 arriving half a second later never reached the backoff. That is a
tight reconnect loop against Rivian's API.
